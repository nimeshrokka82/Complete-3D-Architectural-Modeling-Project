## 🧭 Project Workflow

1.  **Concept & Planning:** Defined room sizes, wall thicknesses, and structural elements.
2.  **2D Drafting:** Created dimensioned floor plans, sections, and elevations in AutoCAD.
3.  **3D Modeling:** Extruded 2D layouts into a 3D mass, applied materials, and set up cameras.
4.  **Rendering:** Configured lighting (Sun Status), materials, and output resolution for final visualization.
5.  **Documentation:** Annotated all drawings with technical specifications and labels.

## 🚀 How to View or Modify

1.  Open `.dwg` files in **AutoCAD** or compatible CAD software.
2.  View `.jpg`/`.png` files in any image viewer.
3.  To re-render the 3D view:
    - Open the DWG file in AutoCAD
    - Type `VIEW` and select "Realistic" visual style
    - Adjust lighting via "Sun Status" and "Create Light"
    - Use `RENDER` command to generate new output
